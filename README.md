## Project Status

Unfinished Project

This project is currently in development. 
The app can validate user credentials and returns access tokens and refresh tokens.It can also validate issued tokens. 
Currently building the ui with react.

## Reflection

  -My first project using the spring boot framework I wanted to build an authentication API cause most applications will need such feature so i could reuse it for future projects.

  -The project's goal was to concilidate my knowledge of the spring framework, learn spring security and object oriented pricipals and design patterns mostly used with the spring framework (SOLID pricipals & Dependancy injection).
